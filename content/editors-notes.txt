chapter: Editor's Notes

subchapter: On Versification

. The Times and Seasons was printed with what we would call "verse numbers" numbering the paragraphs.

. These original verse numbers appear to have been totally discarded when the first publication of the Pearl of Great Price split the paragraphs into sentence sized verses, and numbered those instead.

. For convenience, the paragraph numbering is included as subchapter headings, and the re-versification numbering is also included even though it is not original, because I don't want to introduce a competing versing scheme with what is popularly accepted today as the verse numbers.

. Also, the original source had no "chapters" as such.
